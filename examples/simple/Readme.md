# Simple React app

This shows how to do server-side rendering in a very simplistic way.

It passes the props to `renderToString` and
set the state directly on the component.

## Build

```
$ npm install  # requires Node.js to be installed on the system
$ npm run bundle  # builds ./src/bundle.js

$ pip install python-react-v8
$ python build.py  # creates ./index.html
```

Open `./index.html` in a web-browser.
